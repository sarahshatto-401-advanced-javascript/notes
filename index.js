//our notes application will accept and validate the userâ€™s input, and confirm that the note was valid.//

// As a user, I want to be able to call the application using command line standard syntax, indicating the text of a note I wish to add so that the system will eventually be able to save this note.
// As a user, I expect that the application will confirm my intent. 

// console.log(minimist(process.argv.slice(2)));
// // this is meant to restrict the amount of crap you get back. 

//npm init -y initializes the package, and creates a package.json (metadata for handling the file)

// minimist deals specifically with parsing command line stuff- returns an object instead of an array. Creates key value pairs out of your input.
