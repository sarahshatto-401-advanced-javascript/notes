//our notes application will accept and validate the userâ€™s input, and confirm that the note was valid.//

// As a user, I want to be able to call the application using command line standard syntax, indicating the text of a note I wish to add so that the system will eventually be able to save this note.
// As a user, I expect that the application will confirm my intent.

// minimist deals specifically with parsing command line stuff- returns an object instead of an array. Creates key value pairs out of your input.
